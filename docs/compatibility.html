            Unfortunately, not all plugins and mods are 100% compatible with Nucleus. This page lists some of the known
            issues, and what you can do to work around the issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you know of another incompatibility, please visit us on Discord and talk to us about it.

                        <strong>Critical</strong> issues are where some function of Nucleus is seriously affected in a way server owners
                        are not expecting and have no known workaround, other than removing the plugin in question. It is advised that
                        server owners remove the plugin in question and find an alternative if they wish to use the Nucleus feature it
                        affects.

                        <strong>Major</strong> issues are where some function of Nucleus is seriously affected in a way server owners
                        are not expecting by default but a workaround exists to mitigate or fix the issue.
                    </li>

                        <strong>Minor</strong> issues are where some function of Nucleus can be mildy affected, possibly in an unwanted way,
                        but is not enabled by default or has little impact on day to day server running and management. A workaround exists
                        to restore or use the affected Nucleus functionality.

                        <strong>Info</strong> issues are really non-issues. Incompatibilities with this label tend to be wanted (such as
                        a world management plugin taking over the `/world` command), and are documented here for completeness, along with
                        how to restore or use Nucleus functions.
